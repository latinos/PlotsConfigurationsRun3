### Load the mkShapesRDF environment

Here, we assume `PlotsConfigurationsRun3` was installed in the same directory as `mkShapesRDF`. E.g., let's assume we have a `Run3` directory where we installed both `mkShapesRDF` and `PlotsConfigurationsRun3`.

Then, we can source the `mkShapesRDF` environment using these commands:


    cd ../../mkShapesRDF/
    source start.sh
    cd -

    
### Compile the configuration folder

    mkShapesRDF -c 1

### Run the analysis

Produce histograms using batch:

    mkShapesRDF -o 0 -f . -b 1

Check jobs status:

    mkShapesRDF -o 1 -f .

Resubmit failed jobs:

    mkShapesRDF -o 1 -f . -r 1

Options meanings:
- -o: operationMode:
    - 0 run analysis
    - 1 check batch output and errs
    - 2 merge root files
- -f: folder: it represents the path to the analysis folder
- -b: batch mode:
    - 0 (default) runs on local
    - 1 runs with condor
- -r: resubmit jobs:
    -1 resubmit finished jobs with errors
   - 2 resubmit running jobs

### Merge rootfiles

Once all the jobs have finished, you can merge them:

    mkShapesRDF -o 2 -f .

### Plot distributions

    mkPlot


### to check kerberos

    klist
    

### make datacards
    
    mkDatacards --outputDirDatacard datacards
