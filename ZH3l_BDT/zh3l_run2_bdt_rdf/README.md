# Configuration for ZH3l BDT training

The configurations and files to train BDT(s) for the ZH3l analysis are located in './bdt_train/'. The instructions to run the trainings follow.
    python Classification_BDT.py
Currently no parameter/hyper-parameter optimization has been done. The model architecture and input parameters are also not designed/optimized for best performance. The codes simply establish the pipeline required to train and evaluate a BDT in the mkShapesRDF/PlotsConfigurationsRun3 framework.

### Plot training results

# Evaluating trained BDT

Work in progress. The configurations and files to run the analysis using the trained BDT are stored in './'.
